# Tour Of Heroes

This is a web application developed using Angular that serves as a heroes directory. It allows users to view and manage a collection of heroes, including their names, superpowers, and other details. The application provides a user-friendly interface for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the heroes' data.

Features
View a list of heroes: The application displays a list of heroes with their names and superpowers. Users can browse through the list and select a hero to view more details.

Add a new hero: Users can add new heroes to the directory by providing their name, superpowers, and any additional information.

Edit hero details: The application allows users to update the details of existing heroes. Users can modify the hero's name, superpowers, or any other information associated with them.

Delete a hero: Users have the ability to remove a hero from the directory. This action is irreversible, so users are prompted for confirmation before the deletion is executed.
